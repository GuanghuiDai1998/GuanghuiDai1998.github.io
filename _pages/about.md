I am majoring in automation. My primary area of research lies in the field of robotics particularly Navigation, and Perception. I have a good hold of programming in Python, C, C++. Apart from programming, I have a good hold of simulation software and multiple frameworks for robotics such as ROS, Gazebo, Matlab, Simulink, etc. and,I am focusing on the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in challenging environments. I am also interested in related topcis including multi-sensor fusion, Visual-Inertial Odometry.
